        <p>Matsya (Fish) was the first avatar of Lord Vishnu. When the demon Hayagriva stole the Vedas from Lord Brahma and hid them in the depths of the cosmic ocean, Lord Vishnu took the form of a fish to recover them. During this time, he also saved Manu (the progenitor of mankind) from a great deluge, instructing him to build a boat and collect all species of plants and animals.</p>
